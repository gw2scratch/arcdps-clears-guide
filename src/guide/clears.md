# Checking your clears

## Opening the Clears window

To see your raid clears, open the Clears window. There are multiple ways how to do it:

- Use the [keybind](./keybinds.md) to open the window (`Shift+Alt+C` by default).
- Open the arcdps settings (`Shift+Alt+T` by default) and click the checkbox to open the Clears window:

## The clears window

The clears window has multiple tabs: [My clears](#my-clears), [Friends](#friends), [Settings](#settings).

### My clears

This tab shows raid clears of all your accounts. You may add multiple API keys
if you have multiple accounts, and they will all be shown here.  By default,
finished encounters are shown in green and unfinished encounters are shown in
red.

There are many [customization options](../customization/style.md), including:
- 3 different table styles,
- the account name may be hidden,
- wing and boss numbers may be hidden,
- colors may be changed.

Clears may take a few minutes to update after encounters are finished. This is caused
by delays in the official GW2 API.

#### Choosing shown accounts
If you have multiple accounts added, you may choose which of them should be
shown and which should be hidden. This may be done in the API key management
window, or by right-clicking the window and checking the corresponding checkboxes
in `Shown accounts`.

### Friends
This tab shows raid clears of friends you add in the addon. For more details, read [friends](../friends/how-to.md).

This tab has separate style settings from `My clears`.

### Settings
This tab contains all settings for the addon. Alternatively, the very same
settings may also be accessed in the `Extensions` tab in arcdps settings.
